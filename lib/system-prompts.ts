      "missing_fields": string[] | null
    },
    "context": {

  Rules:
  1. Detect primary intent based on keywords and context
  2. Identify any missing required fields based on intent
  3. Extract temporal context (dates, recurring patterns)
  4. For temporal.reference_date:
     - Use null when user says "today" or current date is implied
     - Only set a specific date when user mentions a different date
  5. Extract financial details (amounts, payment methods)
  6. Identify service provider details if present
  7. Set processor based on primary intent
  8. Confidence should be between 0 and 1
